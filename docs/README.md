# TearSheets
Quick, savable, Tear Sheets. That's it.


##### Overview
TearSheets allows you to save multiple charts as *tearsheets* for later reference. Up to 20 temporary sheets are stored in memory. Saved sheets are written to disk for longer term reference. 

My motivation was from constantly creating charts in jupyter notebooks. I wanted to display them nicely in browser while working and also reference them later. I found myself often either recreating them or saving as images.


##### Tech
Small project, leverages Apache ECharts for visualization.
